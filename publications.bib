	abstract = {Social media has recently become a networked public sphere for social interactions and power struggles in planning practice. However, little research has been done to understand the impact of social media on power relations in collaborative planning. This study uses the Bell and Drum Tower planning practice in Beijing as a case study to elaborate on whether and how social media empowers citizens, experts, and third parties to influence decision-making and promote a communicative planning process. It develops a mixed-methods approach that combines web scraping, social network analysis, and interviews to examine networked power generated by social media. It applies the three dimensions of a network (structure, symmetry, and strength) to measure new forms of power imbalances. The findings show that experts and journalists hold a significant amount of networked power and that social actors can enhance their influence by managing and controlling information flows. Power inequalities exist in the networked public sphere but shift away from governments to other actors, yet without jeopardizing the ultimate decision-making on the ground by the government. This study bridges the gap between network power theory and network science, turning the metaphor of network power into an evidence-based analysis based on a quantitative approach.},

	abstract = {In recent years, social media has become an influential tool for engaging various participants and facilitating inclusivity in digital planning. While many studies highlight local governments' use of social media for formal participation, limited research assesses its impact on power dynamics in informal participation. This study aims to fill the gap by identifying key features of social media that facilitate informal participation and applying Castells' four forms of network power to understand power dynamics among civil society, journalism, citizens, and governments in planning processes. It also develops a novel mixed-methods approach that combines social media scraping, social network analysis (SNA), semi-structured interviews, and field observation. This approach is applied to investigate the Enning Road regeneration project in Guangzhou as a case study. Analyzing data from China's Weibo, the study reveals network disputes across three dimensions: graph, community, and network statistics. Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and community detection results suggest that civil society and journalism have substantial networked power as they strategically utilize social media to promote collaboration, mobilize citizens, and foster communities. They also excise network-making power by switching online and offline networks, thereby transmitting online debate to a wide range of audiences and compelling local governments to shift planning priorities from demolitions to preservation.},

	abstract = {BackgroundCity simulation games provide players a gaming experience by simulating different aspects of the real city. While there is an increasing scholarly interest in games for social learning and education, little research has been conducted to understand citizen perceptions and understanding of urban planning issues in city simulation games.AimThis study aims to understand the affective perception and cognitive learning of citizens regarding urban planning elements in the online communities of Cities: Skylines.Research MethodsWe develop a new methodological approach based on social media data analytics. Large datasets were scraped from Reddit, the most popular social media platform for video game players. The collected data were subjected to content analysis and sentiment analysis that identify different types of topics and emotions to understand citizens’ cognitive and affective perspectives.Key Findings and ConclusionThe findings show that positive emotions were often about the game design, while negative emotions conveyed real-world planning problems such as transportation concerns. The cognitive dimension uncovered citizens’ urban recognition tied to personal experiences in various geographical contexts. This study has practical implications for game design for urban planning.},
