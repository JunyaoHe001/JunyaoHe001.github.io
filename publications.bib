	abstract = {Social media has recently become a networked public sphere for social interactions and power struggles in planning practice. However, little research has been done to understand the impact of social media on power relations in collaborative planning. This study uses the Bell and Drum Tower planning practice in Beijing as a case study to elaborate on whether and how social media empowers citizens, experts, and third parties to influence decision-making and promote a communicative planning process. It develops a mixed-methods approach that combines web scraping, social network analysis, and interviews to examine networked power generated by social media. It applies the three dimensions of a network (structure, symmetry, and strength) to measure new forms of power imbalances. The findings show that experts and journalists hold a significant amount of networked power and that social actors can enhance their influence by managing and controlling information flows. Power inequalities exist in the networked public sphere but shift away from governments to other actors, yet without jeopardizing the ultimate decision-making on the ground by the government. This study bridges the gap between network power theory and network science, turning the metaphor of network power into an evidence-based analysis based on a quantitative approach.},

	abstract = {In recent years, social media has become an influential tool for engaging various participants and facilitating inclusivity in digital planning. While many studies highlight local governments' use of social media for formal participation, limited research assesses its impact on power dynamics in informal participation. This study aims to fill the gap by identifying key features of social media that facilitate informal participation and applying Castells' four forms of network power to understand power dynamics among civil society, journalism, citizens, and governments in planning processes. It also develops a novel mixed-methods approach that combines social media scraping, social network analysis (SNA), semi-structured interviews, and field observation. This approach is applied to investigate the Enning Road regeneration project in Guangzhou as a case study. Analyzing data from China's Weibo, the study reveals network disputes across three dimensions: graph, community, and network statistics. Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and community detection results suggest that civil society and journalism have substantial networked power as they strategically utilize social media to promote collaboration, mobilize citizens, and foster communities. They also excise network-making power by switching online and offline networks, thereby transmitting online debate to a wide range of audiences and compelling local governments to shift planning priorities from demolitions to preservation.},

Large datasets were scraped from Reddit, the most popular social media platform for video game players. The collected data were subjected to content analysis and sentiment analysis that identify different types of topics and emotions to understand citizens’ cognitive and affective perspectives.Key Findings and ConclusionThe findings show that positive emotions were often about the game design, while negative emotions conveyed real-world planning problems such as transportation concerns. The cognitive dimension uncovered citizens’ urban recognition tied to personal experiences in various geographical contexts. This study has practical implications for game design for urban planning.},

Third parties have expanded their influence online, resulting in a profound transformation of power relations in urban planning. This study focuses on the influence of social media on the role, power and impact of third parties in a planning controversy in China. Based on the social network analysis of the data gathered from social media, the research enriches the understanding of the power relations between third parties and other actors in online communication networks. The results show that civil society and journalism use social media to leverage the power and facilitate a more communicative planning process. Although online communities allow for effective organization and actions in planning issues at hand, online discussions do not represent pure public interest but the interests of certain groups.},

  abstract = {Conflicts and power struggles in urban planning have increasingly shifted to digital platforms. Social networking sites, as emerging socio-technical systems, have greatly influenced power relations in planning practices in recent years. Public authorities and urban planners utilize them as digital tools to steer and transform urban planning processes and outcomes. They are also used by elites and professionals to challenge governments’ decisions and show the potential to be an alternative pathway to more inclusive planning. However, there is little research on whether and how social media empowers the grassroots in planning practices. There is also a lack of understanding of how power can be exercised through this digital platform. This study bridges this gap by examining whether and how social networking sites empower the grassroots to challenge the planning authority in planning practice. As a case study, it takes grassroots environmental activism - the Big Banyan Tree controversy in Guangzhou, China. This research develops a new methodology that combines social network analysis and discourse analysis to reveal the influence of social media on citizen empowerment in urban planning. First, we collected extensive digital data from a leading social media platform in China (Weibo). Second, we apply social network analysis (SNA) to model the information flows and interactions between different actors in the case study. We use community detection to measure several virtual communities that are formed through the social media platform. We also identify the relations between different communities and their impacts on power relations in planning practice. Through SNA and community detection, we are able to measure “networked power” generated by social networking sites. Third, we analyze how planning issues are framed and discussed in the networked public sphere of the virtual community. We find that the grassroots strategically uses “discursive legitimacy” as a power source to challenge governments’ decisions. The results indicate that social media can assist the grassroots in reshaping power relations with local governments and empower citizens who cannot participate in planning practices through traditional participatory methods. In the absence of explicit elites, grassroots participants can still challenge planning decisions through network power and discourse legitimacy, even though such challenges hint at new power inequalities. The study shows that social media, as a new networked public sphere, provided dissidents with the ability to articulate and organize public discourse. This also allows the mass media (e.g., newspapers) and NGOs to participate in the network and influence planning controversies as well. In addition, it appears that local authorities in China deal with controversies on social media with greater caution rather than simply resorting to online surveillance tactics to suppress discourse.},

  abstract  = {The communicative turn in Chinese planning practices requires planning professionals to face diverse and conflictual interests and complex urban issues at the neighborhood level. Community planner policy emerges as an institutional innovation, where professionals from different backgrounds are recruited to mediate diverse stakeholder interests in the planning process. However, little research has been conducted on their role as third-party professionals in this context. This study develops a theoretical framework that integrates institutional and agential factors to analyze mechanisms underlying the complexity of third-party professional engagement. We argue that structure–agency interplay is essential for understanding the role of community planners. These planners act as agents with distinct values, knowledge, and skills, yet their actions are also shaped by formal and informal institutions. The findings show that community planners exhibit heterogeneity in performance. They primarily serve governmental interests, often being instrumentalized for the smooth implementation of upper-level policies, while mitigating conflict. Their capacity to function as third parties is primarily motivated by rational considerations and shaped by the hierarchical planning system in which they operate. Only occasionally do community planners approximate the ideal roles posited in communicative or collaborative planning theory.},
