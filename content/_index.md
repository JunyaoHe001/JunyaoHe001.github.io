        - **Urban Planning**  
          I am a doctoral researcher at Utrecht University, specializing in urban planning and social network analysis. My research focuses on understanding power dynamics and stakeholder collaboration in urban planning processes, with a strong emphasis on leveraging digital tools.
        - **Analytical Methods**  
          I apply both qualitative and quantitative methods, such as social network analysis and geospatial modeling, to explore how emerging technologies influence urban planning and public participation.
        - **Collaborations**  
          Please feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on planning, data analysis, or urban innovation! ðŸ˜Š
