        I am a doctoral researcher at Utrecht University, specializing in urban planning and social network analysis. My research focuses on understanding power dynamics and stakeholder collaboration in urban planning processes, with a strong emphasis on leveraging digital tools.

        I apply both qualitative and quantitative methods, such as social network analysis and geospatial modeling, to explore how emerging technologies influence urban planning and public participation.

        Please feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on planning, data analysis, or urban innovation! 😊
