abstract: Social media has recently become a networked public sphere for social interactions
  and power struggles in planning practice. However, little research has been done
  to understand the impact of social media on power relations in collaborative planning.
  This study uses the Bell and Drum Tower planning practice in Beijing as a case study
  to elaborate on whether and how social media empowers citizens, experts, and third
  parties to influence decision-making and promote a communicative planning process.
  It develops a mixed-methods approach that combines web scraping, social network
  analysis, and interviews to examine networked power generated by social media. It
  applies the three dimensions of a network (structure, symmetry, and strength) to
  measure new forms of power imbalances. The findings show that experts and journalists
  hold a significant amount of networked power and that social actors can enhance
  their influence by managing and controlling information flows. Power inequalities
  exist in the networked public sphere but shift away from governments to other actors,
  yet without jeopardizing the ultimate decision-making on the ground by the government.
  This study bridges the gap between network power theory and network science, turning
  the metaphor of network power into an evidence-based analysis based on a quantitative
  approach.
