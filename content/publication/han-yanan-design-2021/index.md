abstract: 'As urban development pays more attention to the embodiment of human-oriented values, spatial transformation and social governance tend to develop synergistically. It is therefore of high research and practical value to explore how to empower the public in the process of micro-renewal. This article aims to summarize and discuss the Shuangjing case to explore how new computer, Internet, Internet of Things, and AR technology and new tools can empower and serve the public from different dimensions and levels in the process of urban micro-renewal. It has been proved that the technologies of intelligent perception, enhanced design, scientific decision-making, and implementation management applied in Shuangjing human and evidence-based participatory design methodology have a strong positive effect in enhancing the inclusiveness of the empowered subjects, improving their ability to participate in design, and the decision-making and maintenance process. The design process of the micro-renewal is also one of empowering the public, by achieving comprehensive empowerment from consultation to plan implementation, which can achieve better social benefits and influence.'
