abstract: 'BackgroundCity simulation games provide players a gaming experience by
  simulating different aspects of the real city. While there is an increasing scholarly
  interest in games for social learning and education, little research has been conducted
  to understand citizen perceptions and understanding of urban planning issues in
  city simulation games.AimThis study aims to understand the affective perception
  and cognitive learning of citizens regarding urban planning elements in the online
  communities of Cities: Skylines.Research MethodsWe develop a new methodological
  approach based on social media data analytics. Large datasets were scraped from
  Reddit, the most popular social media platform for video game players. The collected
  data were subjected to content analysis and sentiment analysis that identify different
  types of topics and emotions to understand citizens’ cognitive and affective perspectives.Key
  Findings and ConclusionThe findings show that positive emotions were often about
  the game design, while negative emotions conveyed real-world planning problems such
  as transportation concerns. The cognitive dimension uncovered citizens’ urban recognition
  tied to personal experiences in various geographical contexts. This study has practical
  implications for game design for urban planning.'
