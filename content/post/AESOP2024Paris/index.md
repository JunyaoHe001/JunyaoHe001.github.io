summary: "Participating in AESOP 2024, presenting research and discussing urban transformations in Paris."

---

Glad to be a presenter at **AESOP 2024**, hosted by the Urban School and the CEE of Sciences Po in **Paris**.  

This year’s theme, *“Game changer? Planning for just and sustainable urban regions”*, offers an engaging platform to explore critical questions related to urban transformations caused by significant events like the Olympics and disasters, often intended to be virtuous but proving counterproductive. 

### Book of Abstracts
