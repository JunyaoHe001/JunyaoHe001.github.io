On **1‚Äì2 May 2025**, I had the pleasure of both **presenting** and **co-organizing** the international conference *Collaborative Planning in the Digital Era: The 2025 International Conference on Collaborative Planning in China and Beyond (CPCB 2025)*, held at **Utrecht University**.

The conference brought together global scholars and practitioners to investigate how **digital tools‚Äîsuch as AI, digital twins, VR, social media, and planning support systems‚Äîreshape citizen participation and power relations** in collaborative planning. It provided an inspiring platform to engage with theoretical, methodological, and empirical advancements in digital planning practice.

### üéô Conference Presentation  
Together with **Dr. Zhen Li**, I presented our research titled  
**‚ÄúSocial Media Influence on Collaborative Planning: Framing in Online Public Participation.‚Äù**  
The presentation explored how framing strategies on social media platforms influence power configurations and legitimacy in participatory urban planning processes, drawing on empirical cases from China.

### üß© Co-Organizing Role  
As part of the organizing team, I worked closely with **Prof. Yanliu Lin**, **Hongmei Lu**, **Pilvi Nummi**, **Kang Cao**, **Xiaomeng Zhou**, **Zhen Li**, and **Zheng Liu** to shape the academic and logistical success of the event.

This conference was supported by an **ERC Starting Grant** and contributes to our upcoming **special issue in *Planning Practice & Research*.**
