ðŸŽ‰ **The 18th International Conference on Computational Urban Planning and Urban Management (CUPUM)**  

Excited to present my research at **CUPUM 2023**, focusing on how **social media** can influence **power relations** in urban planning and decision-making processes.  

This conference brought together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers worldwide to discuss cutting-edge developments in computational methods for urban planning and management. It was an honor to be part of such an inspiring event, showcasing forward-thinking research and interdisciplinary collaboration.  

### My Talk:
- **Title:** Social Media and Power Relations in Urban Planning
- **Themes:** Exploring how social media platforms reshape communication, participation, and power dynamics in urban planning processes.
- **Takeaway:** Social media is a powerful tool for understanding and addressing power imbalances in collaborative urban planning.

Thank you to the CUPUM organizing team and fellow participants for an engaging and enriching experience!
