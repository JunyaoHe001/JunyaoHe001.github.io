summary: "Presenting my work on power dynamics in digital planning and co-organizing a workshop on Urban AI at CUPUM 2025 in London."

---

Excited to be part of **CUPUM 2025**, held this year in **London**, where I had the opportunity to both present and co-organize academic activities around the theme of digital planning.

### üéô Oral Presentation  
I delivered an oral presentation titled **‚ÄúSimulating Power Dynamics in Social Media Participation in Digital Planning: An Agent-Based Model Approach‚Äù**, co-authored with **Dr. Yanliu Lin (Utrecht University)**.  
The paper introduces a novel **agent-based modeling (ABM)** framework that integrates **social media data** and **social network analysis (SNA)** to simulate actor interactions, information diffusion, and power relations within online urban planning controversies. By incorporating dynamic behavior rules and diverse actor types‚Äîincluding citizens, media, experts, and civil society organizations‚Äîthe model sheds light on informal participation mechanisms in digital planning.

### ü™ë Session Chairing  
I also had the pleasure of chairing a parallel session focused on participatory planning and computational modeling in urban governance.

### üß† Workshop Co-Organizer  
Together with **Prof. Stan Geertman**, **Dr. Yanliu Lin**, and **Dr. Nuno Pinto**, I co-organized a well-received workshop titled:  
**‚ÄúDeveloping the Agenda for Digital Planning and AI‚Äù**.

The workshop brought together scholars and practitioners to explore the ethical, infrastructural, and governance challenges posed by **Urban AI**‚Äîincluding generative AI, autonomous systems, and smart city technologies. Participants collaboratively drafted initial guidelines for **responsible and human-centered AI deployment** in urban planning, laying the groundwork for a future research agenda in this critical field.

Looking forward to continuing these conversations and collaborations on the role of AI and digital participation in planning!
