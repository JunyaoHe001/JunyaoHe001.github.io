**Project Duration:** 2020-2021  

This project involved the comprehensive monitoring of over 60 indicators across 12 dimensions at the sub-district and township levels within Beijing. It aimed to provide a data-driven evaluation framework that examines urban patterns, functional sectors, and grassroots governance units, facilitating a holistic understanding of government initiatives, market behaviors, and societal participation in safeguarding public welfare.  

The research leveraged **multi-source big data** to evaluate the balance of "five essential characteristics" in Beijing's development. This included assessing the spatial equity of public service resource allocation and identifying disparities at both municipal and neighborhood levels. By combining **social perception analysis** with **spatial computing techniques**, the project generated actionable insights to enhance the quality of livelihood services and inform policy recommendations.  

### Key Contributions:
- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation:** A systematic approach to understanding the interplay between policy measures, target groups, service standards, and implementation mechanisms.  
- **Social and Emotional Insights:** Leveraged social data to capture public sentiment and evaluate the impact of urban governance strategies on perceived happiness and satisfaction.  
- **Spatial Analysis:** Employed geospatial methodologies to uncover spatial patterns of public resource allocation, enabling precise interventions for equitable development.  

The findings highlighted the importance of aligning public service policies with community needs, refining policy logic, and improving the scientific basis of policy frameworks. This research provides practical standards and policy suggestions for enhancing public welfare services in urban environments.
